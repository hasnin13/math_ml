# Number Theory
**Number Theory** is the branch of mathematics that focuses on the whole number and their properties, such as divisibility, prime numbers, factors, and remainders.

## Number System Overview

### Natural Numbers (ℕ)
- Positive counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, …
- No zero, No negatives.
- Oldest number system used by early humans.
- **Cavemen** used tally marks.

### Whole Numbers
- natural numbers **plus 0**: 0, 1, 2, 3, …
- Introduced with the concept of "zero."
- Zero used for place-holding (e.g., 10, 1000) 
- **Babylonians** introduced zero as a placeholder.

### Integers (ℤ)
- Includes all whole number and their negatives: .., -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...
- Useful for expressing losses, tempurature changes etc.
- Negative numbers accepted after work by indian mathematician **Brahmagupta** (628 AD).

### Rational numbers (ℚ)
- Numbers that can be written as fractions: a/b, where a and b are integers, b ≠ 0.
- Includes:
  - **Integers** (e.g., 3 = 3/1)
  - **Finite decimals** (e.g., 0.75 = 3/4)
  - **Repeating decimals** (e.g., 0.333... = 1/3)
- Useful in measurement, time, and finances.

### Irrational Numbers 
- Cannot be written as fractions.
- Non-terminating, non-repeating decimals.
- Examples : √2, π, e
- Discovered by the **Greeks** (legend of Hippasus proving √2 is irrational).

### Real Numbers (ℝ)
- Combines rational and irrational numbers.
- Includes all numbers on the number line.
- Used in everyday calculations and measurements.

### Imaginary Numbers
- Square root of negative numbers: √−1 = i
- Not found on the real number line.
- Used in advanced math, electrical engineering, and quantum physics.

### Complex Numbers (ℂ)
- Form: **a + bi**, where:
  - **a** = real part
  - **b** = imaginary part
- Includes real, imaginary, and combinations of both.
- Useful in signal processing, control systems, etc.
